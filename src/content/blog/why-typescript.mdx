Hi everyone! üëã if you're in web-development world you would definitely heard about typescript!

> Typescript is used to add data-types to your variables or functions!

ok üëç

- why do you need that?
- why not just use javascript?

Well basically `javascript` is a dynamic language, which means you can assign any type of value to a variable.

```javascript
// we declare a variable with number
let a = 10;
// then we can assign a string to it, it works but this might cause some issues!
a = "hello";
```

Typescript resolves this issue, here is example:

```typescript
// we declare a variable with data-type number
let a: number = 10;
// then if we try to assign a string to it, we'll get an warning from our editor itself!
a = "hello"; // ‚ùå Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
```

Yeah i know shifting from `Javascript` to `Typescript` is a bit difficult, it will be annoying to write types for everything, but but! once you get a hang of it. It becomes drug üíä

<H2>Advantages of using Typescript</H2>

1. Code becomes more predictive, you can skip simple data-type mistakes

```typescript
const [number, setNumber] = useState<number>(0);
setNumber("hello"); // ‚ùå Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'SetStateAction<number>'.
```

2. Handling complex data-structures becomes easier

```typescript
type User = {
  name: string;
  sex: 'male' | 'female';
}

const users: User[] = []

// this will throw an error
users.push({
    name: 'Uppal bal'
    sex: null
})

```

3. First class support for auto-suggestions by your editor

<H2>Type-safety without typescript?</H2>

**JsDoc**

You can use `JsDoc` to add types to your javascript code, but it won't be as good as typescript. here is an example:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @returns {number}
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b; // if you pass a string to it, you won't get any error
}
```

<H2>Bonus</H2>

**End-to-end typesafe**

If your full-stack frameworks like Next.js, Remix etc or using a Monorepo where frontend, backend code written in `javascript` you can use these libraries and get type-safety between your frontend and backend codeüòò.

**Validation**

You can these libraries to validate your data-types on run-time
