Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Let's explore how to build content-driven websites. Examples of such websites include **blogs, documentation sites, and knowledge bases**. The way you structure these websites depends on the source of your content.

<H2>GitHub as a Content Source</H2>

In this approach, content is stored directly within a Git repository. Content is typically written in **Markdown or MDX** files, and a parser is used to convert them into HTML.

**Advantages:**

- âœ… Developer friendly
- âœ… Supports MDX, allowing for highly interactive websites. Check out this [example](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/whimsical-animations/)

**Disadvantages**

- ðŸ˜“ Difficult for non-developers, as content lives within the codebase
- âŒ› Every change requires a deployment, meaning updates are not real-time
- ðŸ“¦ Repository size grows as content increases

**Examples**

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) is framework for building static sites
- [Content collections](https://github.com/sdorra/content-collections)

<H2>Github with an Admin-panel</H2>

This approach is similar to the previous one, but with an admin panel, allowing content to be published directly from a web interface.

**Advantages:**

- âœ… Friendly for both developers and content creators
- âœ… Enables the creation of interactive websites

**Disadvantages**

- âŒ› Changes still require a deployment since content is stored in GitHub
- ðŸ“¦ Repository size grows as content increases

**Examples**

- [Keystatic](https://keystatic.com/)
- [Tina CMS](http://tina.io/)

<H2>Dynamic Content Source</H2>

In this approach, content is fetched from a **database** or a **content provider**, enabling **real-time updates**.

**Advantages:**

- âœ… Content creation and publishing are seamless
- âœ… Scales well for larger websites

**Disadvantages**

- ðŸ’° May incur costs for setup (although free services are available)
- ðŸ¤” Choosing the right stack can be challenging, as there are many options

**Examples**

- [PayloadCMS](https://payloadcms.com/) - A Next.js-native headless CMS
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)
- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)

Each approach has its own pros and cons, so the right choice depends on your use case. If you're a developer comfortable with Git, GitHub-based approaches might work well. If you need real-time publishing and better scalability, a dynamic CMS is the way to go.
